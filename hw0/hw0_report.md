*If you want to include code in your report, you can insert a screenshot (if it's legible), or you can copy/paste the code into a fenced code block.*

```a = 1

try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a"))
    a = a/b
    print("Success a=",a)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0")
except ValueError:
    print("You did not provide a number")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
```
