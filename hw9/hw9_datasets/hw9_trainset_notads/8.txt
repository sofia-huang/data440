Hi Sofia,

My name is Kylah, I am a current student in William & Mary's MSBA program. I gave you a call earlier today and I was reaching out to offer you the student perspective of the program thus far. If you have any questions regarding the curriculum, class structure, program environment, or any general questions I would be happy to answer those for you. Feel free to shoot me an email or give me a call at 757.221.2408 while I'm in the office (Tuesdays & Wednesdays from 11 am-1:30 pm). Have a great day.

Warm Regards,

Kylah Barlow, MA
