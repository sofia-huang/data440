Hi Sofia,

Thank you so much for your email, and for you brother’s interest in the exhibit! Unfortunately, besides a couple of promotional articles and brief snapshots of the exhibit, there is currently no substantial public gallery or resources. However, we are planning to transform the exhibit into a digital one in the future; if you keep an eye on messaging and announcements concerning the Asian Centennial and Asian & Pacific Islander American Studies, you should hear about it when it does.

Best,
