Hi all,

Hope you are well and have already started some data extraction. 

Let's meet physically next week to chat about anything we can do better regarding the data work as a team. Would sometime Monday afternoon or Wednesday after 3pm work for all of you? Let me know as soon as you can. 

I will try to find a room at Chancellor's Hall and let you know. 

Best,
Samuel
