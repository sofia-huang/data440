Hi Sophia, 

I just took a look at your code and both your scrape_article_pages and scrape_url code look great! I do have a couple suggestions for how you can get the text of the articles and it may help resolve the bullet points issue.  Typically, when I'm scraping I use the following methods: driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "").text and driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "").text. If you look at the html of the websites, the tags will be the universal html indicators (h1, p, time, etc.) and the class name will be more site specific. You can try using these methods to see if it resolves the bullet point problem, if not let me know and I'll look into other ways of fixing it. For the popups, you can close popups using a css selector; I'd recommend watching the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_X99_PwFWo). 

As for your question on displaying the webpage while scraping, I don't typically don't do this since there are so many sites to scrape. Instead, I usually keep a record of any web pages that are causing issues by entering the url index number into a list (after 2nd reload of site), which I print at the end of web scraping. 

For future reference, I would also look into multi-threading. Many of the web pages you'll have to scrape in the future will have over 10,000 urls, so it can take a lot of time to scrape. Multi-threading can speed up the process and make scraping more efficient. Here is an article to get you started on this if you're interested: https://towardsdatascience.com/multithreading-multiprocessing-python-180d0975ab29. 

I hope all of this helps, please let me know if you have any more questions!

Sincerely, 
Kritika Jothishankar
