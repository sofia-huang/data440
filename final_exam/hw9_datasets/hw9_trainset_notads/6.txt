Dear all,
Looking forward to presentations today! I have created the following folder for you to upload your presentations to (you will need to be signed in to your william & mary account to upload). You can upload your presentation right before you present! As a reminder, your presentations should take between 4 and 6 minutes and consist of 5 slides: a title slide, at least three content slides, and a closing slide. You should tell us what your plan is, what you've accomplished so far, and fill us in on any problems you have encountered. See you this afternoon!  
Yours, Prof V
