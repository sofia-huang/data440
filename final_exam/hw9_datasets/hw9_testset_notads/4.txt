Hello Hello Everyone!

Thank you to everyone who showed up to the meeting last night and bid farewell to our wonderful graduating senior Brian (woohoo!) and our lovely parting Exec members! The powerpoint can be found here â€” make sure to check it out to see lovely throwback pics of Brian & Exec and a clip from TJâ€™s favorite Chinese show My Fair Princess! The next (and last ) General Body Meeting will be Monday 5/2 from 8-9 pm in James Blair 229 and it will be led by your new 2022-2023 Exec members, so be sure to check us out!

Speaking of new Exec members, hi everyone! This is Audrey, your 2022-2023 Secretary, AKA the person youâ€™ll be hearing from for the next year! Iâ€™ll do my best to carry on Lauraâ€™s (Madam President) legacy and hopefully, you wonâ€™t get sick of me!

Okay: RECAP TIME!!!
