Hi Sofia!

I wanted to touch base about your Fall semester and offer up an option to avoid practice conflicts:
An option for your current practice conflict (MATH 353) is to enroll in a COLL 300 course and take MATH 353 in the Spring. There are still a few open COLL 300 courses on the Course List. MATH 353 is scheduled in the Spring for MWF 1-1:50 pm with Professor Heather Sasinowska.

Let me know if I can help further!
