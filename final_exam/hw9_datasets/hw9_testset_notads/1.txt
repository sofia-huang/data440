Greetings,

Two folks are able to meet tomorrow (Friday, 8/19) at Noon. If anyone is available to join, you're more than welcome. We'll meet at GRI (427 Scotland St.) then walk over to Illy or Aromas and get a coffee/tea. If another time today or tomorrow is better, that's perfectly fine too. Just let me know, and I can meet you seperately.

Thanks,
