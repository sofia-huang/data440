Hi Sofia. I’m so happy you were able to join us for digital DFAS!
 
You would need to complete your undergraduate coursework and 120 credits before you enter the graduate program. As long as you enter W&M will 12-15+ credits, it shouldn’t be too difficult to finish early. We do have some students enter W&M with lots of credit, which only lightens their course load is semester and might not necessitate having to take a course or two over the summer/winter break. Most of our 3+1 students finish what they need in the spring semester of their third year, but some will take their remaining credits in the summer prior to entering the grad program. Our 3+1 student really like being able to earn both degrees in two years: keep social ties with students in their entering UG cohort, reduce tuition by one year, and position themselves to launch into their careers (and earn higher starting salaries) with a graduate degree already in hand.
 
Our MSBA Program has students from many backgrounds – business, computer science, government, economics, public policy, and even education. Each residential cohort is about 90 students -- 25% come from W&M, 70% are domestic students, 20% are international students with US-bachelor degrees, 45% technical background, 45% business/economics/government background.
 
What is in common for this group is that they are all quantitatively oriented, and want to find ways to utilize complex data to ultimately inform decision-making in organizations. It’s kind of a unicorn program relative to the market – and is designed to cultivate individuals who can serve as “translators” between the computer science/programmers and the business decision makers. Those individuals who can interact with both sides will be the folks well-positioned to ultimately lead organizations. For this reason our MSBA program attracts two sets of students.  
·         Those with technical backgrounds who want to learn more about how to leverage data insight within organizations making business decisions. This means learning more about how organizations work -- the type of functional areas within business, understanding the needs of various stakeholders, how data informs short-term and long-term decision-making/investment; and the industries being served – governmental, financial services, energy, healthcare, tech sector, etc. As student expand the knowledge of advanced technical applications, they understand how the business assumptions made in the models greatly inform the outputs. There’s also lots of focus on soft skill and professional development.  
·         Those with business backgrounds who want to further develop technical acumen. These students come to the table with solid business acumen and foundational technical understanding. The MSBA teaches them about on how heuristic algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data visualization can be used for predictive and prescriptive analytics to inform decision-making. Business leaders will need to know the array of technological/analytics tools that can be used to, along with a robust understanding of the underlying model assumptions, in order to inform business practices.
 
The Data Science major is rolling out this fall with a much more structured curriculum. (Previously, it was a guided self-designed major.) There will be tracks to choose from; and there is even some discussion about creating a business track. If you are on the fence, try and keep both options (Computer Science/Data Science) open. This allows you to decide which major you want to choose as an undergraduate. I would advise against double majoring, but you could certainly consider a CSCI/DATA major and a business minor. This minor wouldn’t necessarily have to be business analytics; there’s lots of options! The big advantage of adding the minor (if it fits) is that you’ve then got access to all of our professional development, industry speakers, student orgs, and other business school add-ons.
 
Working closely with an academic advisor will be important right from the start, especially to make sure you’re accounting for course sequencing and balanced workload in a compressed 3 year UG schedule. Summer or winter break study abroad would also be a great addition, and those times won’t interfere with CSCI course sequencing.
 
I hope this information is helpful. Should you decide W&M is the right fit you for, I look forward to being able to meet you in person during new student orientation this fall during the Business School Information Session!  If you have any other questions in the meantime, just let me know.
