First, thank you all for your wonderful work this semester. The energy and commitment you have brought to the course was stellar and it has been a pleasure working with you all!
We will meet in person on TUE 05/03 at the regularly scheduled time to wrap up the term.
Class time on THU 05/05 is yours to use to catch up any remaining, outstanding assignments and/or to continue work on your Digital Story.
Our last in-person meeting will be the Final Exam on Friday, May 13 at 9am. We will be sharing our Digital Stories with each other. I had hoped to have some light refreshments, but s we have seen a recent surge in cases on campus, I think it best if we did not share food and drink together at this time- perhaps a reunion in the fall?
